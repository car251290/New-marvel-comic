# Getting Started with Create React App
## JS 
What's new in ES8?

Asynchronous code is at the core of JavaScript, and ES8 has officially added the ability to declare a function as async. By adding the async keyword in front of a function, you are able to defer the execution of code using the await statement. The return value of an async function is implicitly a promise object.

## REACT
React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.


## Hooks

JavaScript Resources The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time. We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.

API Reference This documentation section is useful when you want to learn more details about a particular React API. For example, React.Component API reference can provide you with details on how setState() works, and what different lifecycle methods are useful for.

Motivation Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that we’ve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether you’re learning React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar component model, you might recognize some of these problems.

## Https
What does HTTPS do?
When properly configured, an HTTPS connection guarantees three things:

Confidentiality. The visitor’s connection is encrypted, obscuring URLs, cookies, and other sensitive metadata.
Authenticity. The visitor is talking to the “real” website, and not to an impersonator or through a person-in-the-middle.
Integrity. The data sent between the visitor and the website has not been tampered with or modified.
A plain HTTP connection can be easily monitored, modified, and impersonated.
